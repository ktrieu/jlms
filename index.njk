        John Lazeez raises the Canadian flag of victory over Berlin. For this feat, he will be chased by the Red Army for three
        days.

      Who was John Lazeez? A Canadian icon? A war hero? A shrewd businessman? A generous philanthropist? John Lazeez was three
      of those things.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Lazeez's story starts during World War II, when he was deployed to serve in the Middle East. After a dedicated tour
      of duty, spent mostly eating the local cuisine, Lazeez was re-deployed to Berlin in the final days of the war.
      Unconfirmed legend has it that Lazeez fired the shot that killed Adolf Hitler.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the war, Lazeez returned to his home country of Canada, where, like many veterans, he began searching for the next
      phase of his life. Finally, Lazeez settled on bringing the cuisine he had enjoyed in the Middle East to his home and
      native land (but without the Luftwaffe attacks).
    </p>
    <p>
      Lazeez Shawarma was born, and is now one of the premier shawarma restaurants in
      Canada.

    <img class="mb-3" src="/static/funeral.png"/>
    <p class="text-center">
      <small>
        John Lazeez's funeral attracted almost 100,000 mourners and caused several trample injuries, symbolizing his impact on
        the community.
      </small>
    </p>
    <p>
      In his lifetime, John Lazeez was a generous philanthropist, donating hundreds of dollars to local causes and take-out
      restaurants. In particular, he founded the John Lazeez Memorial Scholarship, in recognition of the vital role his
      restaurant played in the lives of many university students.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tragically, in 2019, John Lazeez was killed in a garlic sauce accident. However, with his dying words, he expressed his
      greatest wish: to continue his philanthropy so generations of future students could get a good education, like he
      didn't.
    </p>
    <p>
      We pledge to continue his sacred mission, until we forget or run out of
                                        money.
