          John Lazeez raises the Canadian flag of victory over Berlin. For this
          feat, he will be chased by the Red Army for three days.

        Who was John Lazeez? A Canadian icon? A war hero? A shrewd businessman?
        A generous philanthropist? John Lazeez was three of those things.
      </p>
      <p>
        John Lazeez's story starts during World War II, when he was deployed to
        serve in the Middle East. After a dedicated tour of duty, spent mostly
        eating the local cuisine, Lazeez was re-deployed to Berlin in the final
        days of the war. Unconfirmed legend has it that Lazeez fired the shot
        that killed Adolf Hitler.
      </p>
      <p>
        After the war, Lazeez returned to his home country of Canada, where,
        like many veterans, he began searching for the next phase of his life.
        Finally, Lazeez settled on bringing the cuisine he had enjoyed in the
        Middle East to his home and native land (but without the Luftwaffe
        attacks).
      </p>
      <p>
        Lazeez Shawarma was born, and is now one of the premier shawarma
        restaurants in Canada.

          John Lazeez's funeral attracted almost 100,000 mourners and caused
          several trample injuries, symbolizing his impact on the community.
        </small>
      </p>
      <p>
        In his lifetime, John Lazeez was a generous philanthropist, donating
        hundreds of dollars to local causes and take-out restaurants. In
        particular, he founded the John Lazeez Memorial Scholarship, in
        recognition of the vital role his restaurant played in the lives of many
        university students.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tragically, in 2019, John Lazeez was killed in a garlic sauce accident.
        However, with his dying words, he expressed his greatest wish: to
        continue his philanthropy so generations of future students could get a
        good education, like he didn't.
      </p>
      <p>
        We pledge to continue his sacred mission, until we forget or run out of
        money.
