Words are not enough to describe what Lazeez means to me. It is the glistening garlic and tahini that gives flavor to life in Waterloo. It is the base of fresh, fluffy rice that the foundation of my knowledge is built on. It is a coating of delicious, succulent chicken spit-roasted on the finest of grills, giving me the strength to move forward in life. Lazeez has set fire to my soul the way ten lines set fire to a tongue. Lazeez has revolutionized my life as though it too were spit-roasting on the shawarma machine. When life sticks it to me, Lazeez gives me the courage to live on the sticks. And when I'm between a rock and a hard place, Lazeez lets me get back on the rocks. To ask what Lazeez means to me is a meaningless question; like asking what space means to the universe or what silicon means to a computer chip. Lazeez made me. Lazeez is me. Without Lazeez, I would not be. Thank you.
